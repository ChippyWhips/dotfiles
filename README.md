# Dotfiles

Installs dotfiles and some packages for my macOS workstation.

## Setup

Fork the project, and clone your fork to somewhere within your system.

```sh
$ setup.sh
$ install.sh
$ symlink.sh
```

`symlink.sh` will prompt, asking you to confirm before it overwrites files in your current `$HOME`.
